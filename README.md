# Zune - An OpenGL Game Engine

Zune is a 2D/3D game engine being developed in the [Zig programming](https://ziglang.org/) language using OpenGL and GLFW. 
It started as a personal project written in the programming language Odin, but I have since decided to
re-write the framework in the Zig programming language because i have taken a liking to it.

## About the engine

The Zune engine will be completely 3D, you can still ofcourse draw 2D shapes, but everything will always be in a 3d worldspace.
It will be relatively high-level while still being able to access low-level components.

## Short-term Roadmap

- [x] Create a simple mesh rendering system.
- [ ] Add basic mesh shapes.
- [ ] Make the input system function correctly.
- [ ] Create a higher level camera struct.
