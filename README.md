# Zune - A OpenGL game framework

Zune is a 2D/3D game framework being developed in the [Zig programming](https://ziglang.org/) language using OpenGL and GLFW. 
It started as a personal project written in the programming language Odin, but I have since decided to
re-write the framework in the Zig programming language because i have taken a liking to it.
