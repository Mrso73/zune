# Zune - An OpenGL Game Engine

Zune is a 2D/3D game engine being developed in the [Zig programming](https://ziglang.org/) language using OpenGL and GLFW. 
It started as a personal project written in the programming language Odin, but I have since decided to
re-write the framework in the Zig programming language because i have taken a liking to it.



## About the engine

The Zune engine will be completely 3D, you can still ofcourse draw 2D shapes, but everything will always be in a 3d world-space.
It will be relatively high-level while still being able to access low-level components.



## How to install?

- install zig (0.13.0 - soon to be 0.14.0)
- clone the repo
